This is a game built with Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. 
It's a web based application that uses timeout and interval functions to handle how questions are timed.
You have 20 seconds to answer each question. There are 10 questions. A little motivation or unmotivation in between questions. Want to try again? Just hit reset at the end of the game.
